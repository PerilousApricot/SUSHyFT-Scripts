Store configuration files here. Nothing autogenerated

Generally to make a new configuration keep in mind the following:

>  Configurations can't be substrings of any other configuration, if
>   you have a configuration called ```ttbar``` and another called
>   ```ttbar_notau```, bad things will happen. There's a test, but it
>   may not be perfect

Simply copy an old configuration directory, recursively find/replace
the old name with the new name and commit it to git
